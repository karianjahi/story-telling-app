# story-telling-app

In this workshop, you will build a storytelling app that allows users to select a type of story and display a short story of that type. The CSS and the HTML boilerplate has been provided for you.

Begin by creating an h1 element and give it a text Want to hear a short story?.

Create a main element with a class of story-container. Inside the .story-container element, create a div with a class of btn-container.
