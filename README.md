# story-telling-app

In this workshop, you will build a storytelling app that allows users to select a type of story and display a short story of that type. The CSS and the HTML boilerplate has been provided for you.

Begin by creating an h1 element and give it a text Want to hear a short story?.

Create a main element with a class of story-container. Inside the .story-container element, create a div with a class of btn-container.


Inside the .btn-container, create three buttons for each type of story. Give each button a class of btn and an id of scary-btn, funny-btn, and adventure-btn. The text for each button should be Scary Story, Funny Story, and Adventure Story respectively.

Below the .btn-container element, you should have a p element with the id of result. This is where the story will be displayed.


Next, you will start working on the JavaScript. For that, begin by linking the script.js file to your HTML.

Create a script element with its src attribute pointing to the script.js file. 

select the story container element and store in a variable called storyContainer

Select the #scary-btn, #funny-btn, and #adventure-btn buttons and store them in variables called scaryStoryBtn, funnyStoryBtn, and adventureStoryBtn.

Select the #result paragraph and store it in a variable called resultParagraph. You will use this variable to display the selected story.
